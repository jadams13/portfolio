{"name":"Jausan's Portfolio","tagline":"The Official Portfolio of Jausan","body":"### Welcome to The Official Portfolio of James Adams!\r\nJames L. Adams is an independent Drupal and WordPress application developer.  He has worked with both technologies since 2003 in various capacities such as Front-end, Back-end, Web-building, Site operation & maintenance.  James also created the [Las Vegas Independent Drupal Development Group](https://groups.drupal.org/las-vegas-independent-development-group).\r\n\r\n### DRUPAL8 WORK SAMPLES\r\nEmbarking on Drupal 8 has some great benefits such as an improved way of using API's, a solid framework with Symphony, nd a more comprehensive way of incorporating BootStrap.\r\n* * [Romantic Truth](http://home.romantictruth.com)\r\n* [Romantic Truth Dating](http://dating.romantictruth.com)\r\n* [MoveeScript](http://moveescript.jausancorp.com)\r\n* [JausanCorp HRIS](http://hris.jausancorp.com)\r\n\r\n### OTHER WORK SAMPLES\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
